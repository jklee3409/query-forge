## Directory Overview
Spring Boot backend for Admin Console APIs, RAG APIs, pipeline command orchestration, and DB migrations.

---

## Structure
- `src/main/java/io/queryforge/backend/admin/console/*`: synthetic/gating/rag admin APIs and repositories
- `src/main/java/io/queryforge/backend/admin/pipeline/*`: pipeline orchestration and command runners
- `src/main/java/io/queryforge/backend/rag/*`: online RAG API/repository/service
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/*`: Flyway schema migrations
- `src/main/resources/static/react/*`: bundled admin UI assets

---

## Responsibilities
- Provide admin APIs for synthetic query generation, quality gating, and RAG test operations.
- Execute pipeline commands via backend-managed jobs.
- Maintain DB schema evolution through Flyway.
- Preserve strategy-separated synthetic raw storage (A/B/C/D) and split-aware read paths.

---

## Key Notes
- Legacy single-table `synthetic_queries_raw` is retired by migration `V17`.
- Read paths use `synthetic_queries_raw_all` (union view over `synthetic_queries_raw_a/b/c/d`).
- Write/provenance updates for synthetic raw rows are strategy-table specific.
- Admin gating result API supports strategy filtering via `method_code` and paging via `limit/offset`.
