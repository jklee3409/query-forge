## [2026-04-13] Session Summary (Synthetic Raw Split)
- What was done: Updated generation to write directly to strategy-specific raw tables (`synthetic_queries_raw_a/b/c/d`) and updated gating/memory/eval reads to `synthetic_queries_raw_all`.
- Key decisions: Kept read paths unified through the split-backed union view while enforcing strategy-separated writes.
- Issues encountered: Needed compatibility with existing gating/memory/eval flows while removing legacy single-table dependency.
- Next steps: Run end-to-end smoke (`generate-queries -> gate-queries -> build-memory -> build-eval-dataset`) after DB migration apply.

## Notes
- Keep this file concise.
